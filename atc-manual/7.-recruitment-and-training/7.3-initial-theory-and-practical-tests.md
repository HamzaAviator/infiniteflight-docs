### 7.3.4    

All aircraft present at The Initial Practical Test **must**{.red} fly conservative patterns, and **must not**{.red} be bigger than a Boeing 757 (GA and fighter aircraft are also acceptable). The following table lists the items that are included in the Initial Practical test:

 

| Test Element                  | Proficiency Required*                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pushback                      | Correctly identifies if the area is clear for  the aircraft to initiate a pushback maneuver. |
| Taxi                          | Effective ground management, runway selection  (usually based on wind) and use of give way commands if appropriate. |
| Departure                     | Use of LUAW or anticipated separation if  appropriate, use of left/right traffic for aircraft remaining in the pattern. |
| **Aircraft Separation**{.red} | Ensures that separation minima is complied with at all times, i.e. Dep/Dep, Arr/Arr, Dep/Arr and Intersecting *(see [3.1.1](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.1-separation#3.1.1) above)* |
| Runway  Usage                 | Effective use of both runways, and  facilitating requests for runway changes. |
| Pattern                       | Effective pattern management including  pattern entries (if required), sequencing (if required) and clearances. |
| Transition                    | Transition given that keeps inbound aircraft  within tower airspace and clear of aircraft in the pattern. |
| Go-Around                     | Proactive monitoring of separation between arrivals  and use of go-arounds when required. |
| Runway  Exit                  | Use of exit runway command with appropriate  use of expedite (if required). |

**Automatic Failure: if proficiency is not met for elements marked in red, the test is automatically failed.**{.red}

**The recruiter has the final say on the result of the test (see [7.1.1](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.1-overview#7.1.1) above)*
