# 6.13  Handover to Tower/Unicom

 

### 6.13.1    

Before the Controller can hand an aircraft over to Tower/Unicom they **must**{.red} ensure that the aircraft has successfully established on the "intended approach path" **AND**{.red} has an acceptable closure rate with the aircraft ahead.

 

### 6.13.2    

The "intended approach path" for the GPS Approach, Radar Vectors and a Visual Approach are covered above *(see [6.9.3](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.9-global-positioning-system-(gps)-approach#6.9.3), [6.11.1](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.11-radar-vectors#6.11.1) and [6.12.3](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.12-visual-approach#6.12.3) above respectively)*. For the ILS approach, Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that the aircraft has successfully intercepted the LOC, this is especially important when parallel operations are in use *(see 6.13.2.1 below)*. Do not confuse aircraft being established on the LOC, with ‘being in the cone’ – aircraft must be aligned with the centerline of the runway to be established, regardless of their position inside or outside of the cone.

### 6.13.3    

Radar Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that the aircraft closure rate is "acceptable" - this can vary but a good example is if Aircraft A is established on the ILS ahead, and you have just issued the final intercept to Aircraft B, ask yourself what is their relative speed to each other? If Aircraft A is at 180kts GS (Groundspeed), and Aircraft B is intercepting at 250kts GS with only 3nm spacing, what will happen? Don’t give this problem to the Tower Controller, they do not have extensive speed commands like Radar - instead, slow Aircraft B down first, then hand over. All Tower Controllers can give to aircraft is ‘maintain slowest practical speed’, this could then have a knock-on effect if you have a line of aircraft on approach.



### 6.13.4

Additionally, to ensure that the separation provided between aircraft is not compromised, Radar Controllers **should**{.red} keep aircraft on frequency until they can be sure of this (this may mean that aircraft are kept on frequency down the final approach until fairly "late" - this is encouraged over the Tower Controller having to issue a go-around due to separation issues). It is important to note that the Tower Controller's main responsibility (when a Radar Controller is present), is issuing the landing clearance; separation is set by the Radar Controller and therefore keeping aircraft until much later (even until 5 miles final) may be required to ensure this is provided.
