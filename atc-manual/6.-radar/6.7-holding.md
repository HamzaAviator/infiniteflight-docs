# 6.7 Holding



## What is a Hold?

### 6.7.1    

The use of holds can be a very useful tool for Radar Controllers, in particular, they can help with:

 

 -    Congested airspace

 -    Aircraft that are high to lose altitude

 -    Delay arrivals to assist with clearing a long departure line

 -    A full destination airport

 

### 6.7.2 

Controllers can utilize airports, fixes or the aircraft’s present position for a hold. When selected, it will create a hold that the pilot will be able to follow on their map display, and will also automatically issue a speed command based on the selected altitude for the hold.



### 6.7.3 

Currently holds do not appear on the Radar Controller’s display. Due to this, it is important to know what a pilot is likely to fly if issued with a hold, including the expected flight path for a hold *(see 6.7.4.1 below)*, and the type of hold entries *(see 6.7.6.1 below)*.

 

### 6.7.4

The standard pattern of a hold is shown in the below image *(see 6.7.4.1 below)*:

## Hold Entries

### 6.7.5  

There are three types of hold entries, these are:

 

 -    Direct

 -    Parallel

 -    Teardrop

 

### 6.7.6

If an aircraft is approaching a hold from the direct entry side as shown in the image *(see 6.7.6.1 below)*, Controllers can expect the aircraft to go "direct" to the origin of the hold and then fly the standard holding pattern from there. For a parallel entry, a flight path similar to the blue line below can be expected before the standard holding pattern is flown. And finally, for the teardrop entry, a flight path similar to the red line.
