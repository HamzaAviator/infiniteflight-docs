# 1A.1  Discord Communication

 

Tip

: Infinite Flight app related issues can be discussed within the IFATC Discord Channels for advice; however, for official support, the [IFC Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/support/17) **must**{.red} be used



## General

### 1A.1.1

## Voice Channels

### 1A.1.4

The use of Voice Channels (VCs) **must**{.red} only be used in accordance with the Discord Rules *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.2-discord-rules#1a.2.1) below)*. Controllers who are operating an airport independently without assistance **should not**{.red} claim a VC unless:

- the control positions are split (e.g. passing Ground control to another member whilst still operating Tower)
- a Radar Controller opens at the airport
- and/or all facility Controllers opt to communicate via a VC in *#controllers*



### 1A.1.5

The use of VCs is **not required**{.red} and is at the sole discretion of the Controller (there may be select events where the use of VCs is required to guarantee operational efficiency - if this is the case, Controllers that do not wish to use voice may have to control elsewhere). Controllers who wish to observe others in a VC for educational purposes may **ONLY** do so if **ALL** operational Controllers in the VC have given consent. Observers **must not**{.red} distract from the active ATC operation and **should**{.red} remain muted.



### 1A.1.6

To open a VC, the following steps are to be followed:



Step 1

: Open the IFATC Discord and using the navigation bar on the left side of the screen, find "Controlling VCS"



Step 2

: Click "Hub - Join to create", a new VC will be created that will automatically be titled with your Discord username



Step 3

: The VC title **must**{.red} then be changed to an appropriate name so that it is clear to other Controllers what the VC purpose is. Examples could include the ICAO code for Controllers operating a particular airport or the name of an area if it includes multiple airports *(see [1A.1.7](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.1-discord-communication#1a.1.7) below)*



### 1A.1.7

Below are the commands that can be used in the *#botcommands* Discord channel to manage a VC:



| Commands        | Purpose                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| !voice-claim    | Claim ownership of the VC       |
| !voice-limit    | Change the user limit of the VC |
| !voice-owner    | Change ownership of the VC      |
| !voice-rename   | Rename the VC                   |
| !voice-transfer | Transfer ownership of the VC    |



### 1A.1.8

Below are some useful tips for VCs:

- You can see how many members currently occupy a VC at any time by noting the [00/08] channel count
- Selecting "Mute" means no one can hear you
- Selecting "Deafen" means you don't hear anyone else
- Always double check your sound settings (i.e. Input = Mic and Output = Speaker)
- Connecting to a VC will act much like a phone call and can run in the background while controlling
