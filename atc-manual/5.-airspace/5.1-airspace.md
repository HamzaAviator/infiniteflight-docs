# 5.1 Airspace

 

### 5.1.1 

Controller airspace is defined by it's vertical jurisdiction, lateral boundaries and frequency range for the facility being operated. Below is a summary for each Controller position:



| Facility           | Vertical Jurisdiction | Lateral Boundary                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Tower              | SFC - 5000ft AAL      | Most immediate ring/boundary surrounding the airport |
| Departure/Approach | SFC - 18,000ft/FL180  | 50nm                                                 |
| Center             | SFC - 60,000ft/FL600  | White boundaries                                     |

*Note: Airspace parameters and ATC jurisdictions may be altered with the use of NOTAMs and/or TFRs during special events*

### 5.1.2 

Departure/Approach facilities are intended to service a single airport or cluster of airports in close proximity, whereas Center is a region based facility that fills in the gaps outside of Departure/Approach radio range.



### 5.1.3

Center Controller's may exercise Departure/Approach functions in the absence of a terminal radar facility (i.e. Departure/Approach), though this should be limited, with the primary focus on Center Controller roles *(see [6.6.1](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.6-center#6.6.1) below)*.



### 5.1.4

Special Use airspaces such as Military Operating Areas (MOAS), Warning Areas and Restricted Areas are identified with magenta boundaries. For the purposes of Infinite Flight these are currently not enforced or monitored.



### 5.1.5

The different types of airspace are defined using a color code and these are shown in the following table **for information only**{.red}:



| Airspace Type                   | Color Code  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Class B                         | Blue        |
| Class C                         | Magenta     |
| Class D                         | Light Blue  |
| Terminal Control Area           | Light Green |
| Flight Information Region (FIR) | White       |
