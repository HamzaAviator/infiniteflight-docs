# 5.2 On Guard Procedures

 

Tip

: When opening a frequency, Controllers **must**{.red} allow time for things to settle; for example, do not "on guard" aircraft on short final, allow the aircraft to land and complete the rollout uninterrupted

 

### 5.2.1    

Controllers **must**{.red} always check what frequency the aircraft is tuned into before sending an "on guard" message in case they are with another tower/radar facility. Radar Controllers **should**{.red} also be aware of an aircraft's active/away status *(see [6.6.5](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.6-center#6.6.5) below)*. Below is a summary of when "on guard" procedures are applicable, aircraft **must not**{.red} be "on guarded" outside of these limits:



| Facility           | Vertical and Lateral Limits                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Tower              | SFC - 10,000ft AAL and within 25nm          |
| Departure/Approach | SFC - 18,000ft AAL / FL180 and within 50nm  |
| Center             | SFC - FL600 and within the white boundaries |

*Note: If the airport elevation is deemed significant, Controllers may elect to take this into account (e.g. with an airport elevation of 5000ft, Controllers may adjust the 'on guard' altitude/FL by 5000ft/FL50 respectively)*



### 5.2.2

Aircraft **should**{.red} be given a reasonable amount of time to tune into the frequency after being "on guarded", in addition aircraft **must not**{.red} be 'on guarded' if on another active frequency.
