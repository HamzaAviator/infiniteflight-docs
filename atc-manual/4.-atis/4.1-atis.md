# 4.1 ATIS

 

Tip

: Controllers **should**{.red} avoid adding too many REMARKS and NOTAMS into a single ATIS as this will dilute the message – Controllers **should**{.red} ask themselves what the most important messages are, and prioritise as required *(see [4.1.6](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.1-atis#4.1.6) below)*



### 4.1.1    

The Automatic Terminal Information Service, known as ATIS; enables the Controllers to broadcast the current weather as well as REMARKS and NOTAMS for pilots to be aware of. **ALL**{.red} available runways **should**{.red} be used – one runway for departures and another runway for arrivals **should**{.red} be avoided if possible. Controllers may however, be exposed to an airport where terrain, airport layout or weather prevents **ALL**{.red} runways from being used; in this case it is acceptable to not use **ALL**{.red} runways (if there are any doubts as to what strategy **should**{.red} be used, Controllers **should**{.red} raise this with a Supervisor or above for guidance).



### 4.1.2    

Pattern work **must**{.red} be denied if the weather conditions, terrain or traffic are not suitable *(see [3.4.1](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.4-pattern-work-transitions-flight-of-xx#3.4.1) above)*.



### 4.1.3    

A letter of the Phonetic Alphabet is used to identify an ATIS transmission, this letter is then relayed between pilots and Controllers to ensure everyone is operating under the same airfield information. At any time, if the current ATIS does not reflect the current situation (including changes in weather or SIDs/STARs in use), Controllers **must**{.red} change the ATIS without delay and ensure real time coordination with the other Controllers involved. As a **MINIMUM**{.red}, the ATIS must be updated at least once an hour. In addition, a broadcast **must**{.red} be made on Ground/Tower/Radar to ensure pilots check the new ATIS.



### 4.1.4    

The letters used when updating the ATIS **must**{.red} be in alphabetical order and typically starts at Alpha unless the Controller has just taken over from another Controller.



### 4.1.5    

The facility to open multiple Ground/Tower/Radar frequencies exist at some airports. This can be useful when managing busy traffic. If this is to be used Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that the ATIS is updated to reflect this (i.e. which frequency to contact, from which direction), prior coordination is made with the other Controllers; and during the controlling session, the IFATC Discord Channels are used to provide a good service.

 

### 4.1.6    

The table below highlights when certain REMARKS or NOTAMS **should**{.red} be used:

 

| REMARK  / NOTAM       | When to be used?                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No Intersection Dept. | Intersection departures **must**{.red} always be allowed unless it blocks the only taxiway for aircraft to access full length **AND**{.red} will affect the departure/arrival flow rate *(see [3.2.5](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.5) above)* |
| No Pattern Work       | Weather below VMC? Terrain prevents a standard pattern from being flown? **CURRENT**{.red} traffic levels will cause a drop in service standards? When 1 of these conditions is met, No Pattern Work **must**{.red} be used *(see [3.4.1](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.4-pattern-work-transitions-flight-of-xx#3.4.1) above)* |
| Flow Control          | Aircraft can expect a delay for departure if the Controller is trying to limit departing traffic (this could be due to aircraft all heading for the same destination) |
| Long Taxi             | If the runways in use mean that some aircraft can expect a long taxi |
| Gate Hold             | The use of hold position *(see [2.1.3](/guide/atc-manual/2.-ground/2.1-runway-selection-and-pushback#2.1.3) above)* **should**{.red} be favored but if a long line of  departures needs to be cleared and you have limited space on the taxiways,  gate hold can be used (it **should**{.red} be limited to a maximum of 10 minutes) |
| No Light Aircraft     | This command **must**{.red} be used at **ALL**{.red} times for large airports that do not accept light aircraft IRL (e.g. EGLL, OMDB, VHHH etc). In addition, it is important to note that this command is not traffic dependent – a consistent message **must**{.red} be sent that there are other, more appropriate airports for light* aircraft |
| Rolling Dept.         | To expedite departures – when aircraft are cleared for take-off they will be expected to line up and start their take-off roll immediately. The LUAW command **must not**{.red} be used when this is in use |
| FPL Required          | Only to be used when weather is below VMC minima *(see [3.4.1](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.4-pattern-work-transitions-flight-of-xx#3.4.1) above)* or when SID/STAR usage is mandated |
| Straight Out Dept. ** | Runway heading **must**{.red} be flown after departure until no conflict exists **AND**{.red} the altitude specified by the Tower Controller has been met or exceeded *(see [3.2.8](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.8) above)* |
| Mult. Freq. In Use    | *(See [4.1.5](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.1-atis#4.1.5) above)* |
| Check Forum           | Only to be used when referring pilots to special instructions on the IFC pages e.g. VARB Summit |
| SID/STAR Use Rcmd***  | This command **should**{.red} be used when light to moderate traffic exists and SID/STAR use is not essential for traffic management *(see [4.1.7](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.1-atis#4.1.7) below)* |
| SID/STAR Use Req***   | This command **should**{.red} be used when heavy traffic exists and SID/STAR use is essential for traffic management **OR**{.red} for events and/or main hub airports  *(see [4.1.7](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.1-atis#4.1.7) below)* |
| Event                 | IF LLC sponsored events only                                 |
| Size Restrictions     | When any aircraft cannot be accommodated because their size will restrict airport flow (i.e. block taxiways or ramp areas), this command **must**{.red} be used *(see [2.1.1](/guide/atc-manual/2.-ground/2.1-runway-selection-and-pushback#2.1.1) above)* |
| Severe Weather        | High winds, turbulence and any other weather related phenomena |
| Low Visibility        | Low Visibility – visibility less than ¼  statute miles (400m) |

 

*For the purposes of IF, "light" aircraft are defined as the C172, SR22, XCub, Spitfire Mk VIII and P38.

**Take note that the use of "Straight Out Dept." may prevent aircraft from flying their selected SID *(see [3.2.8](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.8) above)*

***Only to be used if the airport has published SID/STAR procedures available



### 4.1.7

Controller's can select the preferred SIDs/STARs for the airport and **should**{.red} include a reasonable variety of authorized procedures to allow for departures/arrivals from **ALL**{.red} directions. By convention, this **should**{.red} be decided by Radar Controllers (in their absence, the Tower Controller may choose but this is not encouraged).
