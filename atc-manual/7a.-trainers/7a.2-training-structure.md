# 7A.2 Training Structure 



### 7A.2.1

Candidates/Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that all requirements are met before requesting training. These requirements and the full process are outlined in the following locations:

 

| Trainee Type | Location                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Candidate    | [ATC Training Post](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/atc-training/416531) on the IFC Forum |
| Controller   | See [7.5](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests) above |



### 7A.2.2

All Trainers **must**{.red} proactively monitor the website for [training requests](https://if-atc.com/atc/waitlist). Trainees **should**{.red} be claimed within a 7 day timeframe by accepting the request *(see [7A.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/7a.-trainers/7a.3-trainer-admin#7a.3.1) below).*



### 7A.2.3

Once a Trainer has accepted a training request *(see [7A.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/7a.-trainers/7a.3-trainer-admin#7a.3.1) below)*, the Trainer **must**{.red} message the Trainee to begin dialogue and to organize training sessions. All sessions **must**{.red} be added to the [Training Schedule](https://if-atc.com/atc/schedule) on the website. Each session is broken down into half hour blocks every day on a weekly basis, allowing for multiple Trainers and Trainees to coordinate their own sessions. Training **must not**{.red} be conducted between 1700Z and 2359Z on Fridays unless prior authorization has been given due to limited availability of the trainer and/or trainee.



### 7A.2.4

A first-come, first-served basis is utilized for slots in the Training Schedule. Equal priority is shared with respect to the time(s) booked by those who need them (not applicable to testing).	



### 7A.2.5

Trainers **should**{.red} utilize the "Request Pilots On Discord" website function 30 - 60 minutes before a scheduled training session *(see [7A.3.3](/guide/atc-manual/7a.-trainers/7a.3-trainer-admin#7a.3.3) below)* which will send a notification to the *#training-time* Discord channel for pilots. Once the specific training channel to be used for that session is established, all subsequent coordination **should**{.red} only be in that channel.



### 7A.2.6

Trainers reserve the right to terminate training at any point *(see [7.1.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.1-overview#7.1.4) above and [7A.3.6](/guide/atc-manual/7a.-trainers/7a.3-trainer-admin#7a.3.6) below)*, but **should**{.red} speak to the Trainee's Recruiter **BEFORE** termination as this may effect the Trainee's eligibility for joining IFATC (or future promotions if already within IFATC). A two strike policy is normally observed allowing the Trainee the benefit of the doubt when mistakes are made however appeals may be reviewed by the Training Team Administrator and/or the IFATC Manager on a case-by-case basis. 



Reasons for termination can include (but are not limited to):



- failure to respond or communicate with their assigned Trainer(s)
- failure to attend scheduled training sessions
- not receptive to feedback and/or a bad attitude



### 7A.2.7

For Initial Training, Trainers **must**{.red} conduct training at airports with parallel and/or intersecting runways depending on the circumstances of their Trainees. The following list outlines recommended airports for Radar Training (Trainers are encouraged to rotate through each site on a consistent basis). Trainers **must not**{.red} train (or allow training to take place) at test sites in order to avoid any unfair advantages *(see [7B.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.2-initial-testing#7b.2.1) and [7B.3.2](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.3-radar-testing#7b.3.2) below)*:



+++ Beginner Airports

TBC

+++



+++ Intermediate Airports

**Location:** KONT (elevation 944ft)

**Airport Details:**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 08L  | ILS           |
| 08R  | GPS           |
| 26L  | ILS           |
| 26R  | ILS           |

**Notes:** High terrain to the north and northeast of the airport as well as a series of large peaks to the south and southeast. Runways are too close for parallel ops, staggered approach technique needs to be used when using both runways. Tight downwind (within 5 miles) required on the north side of the airport.



**Location:** KSNA (elevation 56ft)

**Airport Details:**

| RWY  | Approach Type             |
| ---- | ------------------------- |
| 02L  | GPS                       |
| 02R  | GPS (light aircraft only) |
| 20L  | GPS (light aircraft only) |
| 20R  | ILS                       |

**Notes:** High terrain to the east of the airport. Runways are too close for parallel ops, staggered approach technique needs to be used when using both runways.



**Location:** LFMN (elevation 12ft)

**Airport Details:**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 04L  | ILS           |
| 04R  | ILS           |
| 22L  | Visual        |
| 22R  | Visual        |

**Notes:** High terrain to the north and northeast of the airport. Runways are too close for parallel ops, staggered approach technique needs to be used when using both runways. Northeasterly runway configuration is preferred, southwesterly runway configuration can be used for advanced visual approach training.

+++ Advanced Airports

**Location:** LEMG (elevation 52ft)

**Airport Details:**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 12   | ILS           |
| 13   | ILS           |
| 30   | GPS           |
| 31   | ILS           |

**Notes:** High terrain surrounds the airport with the exception of the coastline to the south. Approach paths converge for southeasterly ops and departure paths converge for northwesterly ops - staggered approach technique needs to be used when using both runways. With southeasterly ops, use of southerly region recommended for aircraft to gain height before being turned downwind

### 7A.2.8
