# Pushback



A pushback is a maneuver that can be used by aircraft to position from their parked position, onto a taxiway ready to taxi.



Tip

: General Aviation (GA) and military aircraft (with the exception of the C-130) are not able to perform a pushback maneuver

Step 1

: When an aircraft requests pushback, the aircraft symbol will flash amber on the map as well as their callsign on the flight progress strip



Step 2

: Either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 3

: If it is clear, tap "Pushback Approved > Send". In all other cases tap "Hold Position"



## Flow Control

Flow Control is a technique used by Controllers to limit the amount of aircraft inbound to a particular destination. This is usually done by holding aircraft at the gate to help stagger departures.
