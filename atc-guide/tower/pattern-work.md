# Pattern Work

The traffic pattern is a standard flight path followed by aircraft when taking-off and landing while maintaining visual contact with the airport. In Infinite Flight the pattern altitude is 1000ft AAL (above aerodrome level) for prop aircraft, and 1500ft AAL for jet aircraft. It consists of multiple legs, each being joined by a 90 degree turn, and these are shown in the image below:

Manual

: For Pattern Work to be allowed, Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) **must**{.red} exist, aircraft **must**{.red} be able to fly a standard pattern and traffic levels need to be manageable. [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.4-pattern-work-transitions-flight-of-xx#3.4.1) 



+++ SCENARIO - Re-Sequencing

::: scenario-heading
Scenario
:::

::: scenario
*I-DRUM* and *N1DC* have both already been sequenced and cleared for RWY05L. As both aircraft continue downwind, *I-DRUM* has gone further downwind than the Controller expected.

| Technique 1                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Re-clear *N1DC* as number 1                                  |
| Re-sequence *I-DRUM* as number 2                             |
| If you are concerned about separation, you can tell *I-DRUM* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to alleviate this |

| :fa-times-circle: | May increase workload as you have to send various commands |

| Technique 2                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- |
| Instruct *I-DRUM* to "turn base"                  |
| This will force *I-DRUM* to fly a tighter pattern |

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :fa-check-circle: | Can be efficient                                             |
| :fa-times-circle: | Some pilots/aircraft may not be able to fly as tight a pattern |
