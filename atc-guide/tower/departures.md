# Departures



[INSERT CLIP]



## Hold Short



The use of "hold short" is primarily used with departing traffic to ensure that they do not enter the runway until cleared to do so.



Manual

: If an aircraft requests take-off and you cannot clear them or issue a LUAW command, then the "hold short" command **must**{.red} be used. [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.1)



Step 1

: When an aircraft calls ready for departure, the aircraft symbol will flash amber on the map as well as their callsign on the flight progress strip



Step 2

: Either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 3

: If it is not appropriate to issue a take-off or LUAW clearance, tap "Hold Short > [select RWY]" instead



## Departure Sequence



When there are multiple aircraft queuing for departure, it can be useful to provide sequencing information so that aircraft know what order to expect departure in.



Manual

: Any aircraft that is instructed to LUAW or cleared for take-off is no longer considered in the departure sequence - therefore the next aircraft at the hold short line is now considered number 1 for departure. [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.2)



Step 1

: To let aircraft know their departure number, either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 2

: Tap "Departure Sequence > [select departure number]"



## Line Up & Wait (LUAW)



With one departure rolling and another aircraft holding short of the runway, sometimes anticipated separation may be better and you can just clear the second aircraft for take-off if you know the first aircraft will be airborne by the time they start rolling. But if you are in doubt, or if you have just had an aircraft land, then using the "Line Up & Wait" (LUAW) command may be more appropriate.



The use of this command instructs the aircraft holding short to taxi onto the runway and line up ready for departure meaning that as soon as separation criteria is satisfied, you can clear them for take-off.



Manual

: Controllers can issue the LUAW command to more than one aircraft provided it will not compromise the integrity of the first aircraft that is due to depart. [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.3)



Step 1

: When an aircraft calls ready for departure, the aircraft symbol will flash amber on the map as well as their callsign on the flight progress strip



Step 2

: Either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 3

: If you want to issue a LUAW command tap "Line Up & Wait > [select RWY]" 



## Back-Taxi

A back-taxi instruction will be required if the aircraft is unable to access full length for departure or when landing aircraft have passed the last available runway exit.



Manual

: Controllers **should**{.red} be proactive by planning for the worst case scenario in terms of separation, and in particular; **should**{.red} expect the aircraft to back-taxi no faster than normal taxiing speeds. [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.4)

Step 1

: When an aircraft calls ready for departure, the aircraft symbol will flash amber on the map as well as their callsign on the flight progress strip



Step 2

: Either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 3

: If you want to issue a LUAW command tap "Back Taxi > [select RWY] > [select Contact Ground when off the Runway / LUAW] > [select Send / Expedite]"



| Options                              | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Contact Ground when off the Runway" | Once the aircraft has completed the back-taxi and vacated the runway, they can contact Ground |
| "Line Up & Wait"                     | Once the aircraft has completed the back-taxi they can do a 180 turn on the runway, ready for departure |
| "Send"                               | Sends the back-taxi instruction                              |
| "Expedite"                           | Sends the back-taxi instruction but asks the aircraft to expedite (usually due to arrival traffic) |



## Intersection Departures

Utilizing multiple entry points to the runway for departure will give you the flexibility to decide on the departure sequence. The table below gives some examples of when this can be useful:



| Considerations       | Why                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Aircraft Flight Plan | If multiple departures are about to be cleared with no arrivals in-between, choose aircraft that depart in alternate directions to help ease airspace congestion |
| Aircraft Size        | If the gap between two arrivals looks quite close, perhaps consider choosing an aircraft that you know will be able to depart quicker (e.g. a fighter jet instead of a large commercial aircraft) |
| Aircraft position    | You may be able to depart aircraft quicker if you line up two aircraft at the same time |



Manual

: Controllers **should not**{.red} view intersection departures as "queue jumping", but instead use it to their advantage to provide an expeditious service. [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.5)



## Take-Off



Step 1

: When an aircraft calls ready for departure, the aircraft symbol will flash amber on the map as well as their callsign on the flight progress strip



Step 2

: Either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 3

: If you want to issue a take-off clearance, tap "Cleared for Takeoff > [select option]"



| Options                     | When to Use                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Send"                      | In most cases when you want to just send a normal take-off clearance |
| "Straight Out (Altitude)"   | When "Straight Out Dept." is being broadcast in the current ATIS. Aircraft will fly runway heading until they have reached the altitude specified AND no conflict exists |
| "Request Immediate Takeoff" | Recommended when separation is likely to be lost between the departing aircraft and arrival traffic on final (usually within 2nm) |
