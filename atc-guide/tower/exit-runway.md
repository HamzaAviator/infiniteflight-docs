# Exit Runway



Manual

: The Exit Runway command **should**{.red} be given once the aircraft is at a safe and controlled speed, typically less than 70kts. [More Info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.5-exit-runway-go-around#3.5.1)



[INSERT CLIP]



Step 1

: Tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 2

: Tap "Exit Runway > [select left/right/any] > [select from options below]"



| Options                                    | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Send"                                     | Sends normal exit command with permission to change frequency |
| "Expedite"                                 | Sends "expedite" exit command with permission to change frequency |
| "Expedite, Traffic on [Select Final/Base]" | Sends "expedite" exit command (and position of landing traffic) with permission to change frequency |
| "Cross Runway > [Select RWY]"              | Sends normal exit command, permission to cross another runway and to change frequency |
| "Hold Short > [Select RWY]"                | Sends normal exit command and instructions to hold short of another runway. Aircraft remain on frequency and only changed to ground once traffic has crossed the runway |



Tip

: The expedite command is usually best used when there is an aircraft on final within 2nm (or 3nm with another aircraft lined up on the runway ready to depart) 



Step 3

: Dependant on what option is sent, a frequency change may be required. To do this, tap "Contact Other Frequency > [select frequency]"
