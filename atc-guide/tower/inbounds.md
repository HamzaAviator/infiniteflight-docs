# Inbounds



## Pattern Entry, Sequence and Clearance

In Infinite Flight the pattern altitude is 1000ft AAL (above aerodrome level) for prop aircraft, and 1500ft AAL for jet aircraft. It consists of multiple legs, each being joined by a 90 degree turn, and these are shown in the image below:



![The Traffic Pattern](_images/manual/graphics/atc-traffic-pattern.jpg)



Pattern entries are key in making sure that pilots know where to join the pattern, and by doing so, promotes airport efficiency and good traffic management. Controllers can do this by imagining that each pattern leg continues to extend out, away from the airport. The leg that intersects with the aircraft's flight path is usually the best option but Controllers may need to change this based on current traffic. 



The art of sequencing allows controllers to let pilots know who they are supposed to be following and is not just to be used with aircraft in the pattern. All inbounds need to be told who they are following, unless of course they aren't following anyone! For effective sequencing, it requires:



- both the controller and the pilot to have a knowledge of the different pattern legs
- the controller to issue sequencing in good time to keep the pilots informed
- the controller to update the sequencing when things change or don't go to plan
- the pilots to be courteous to each other by giving each pilot the space they need to maneuver
- the pilots to follow the issued sequence

Manual

: When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL**{.red} aircraft as a **MINIMUM**{.red}, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency - the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic. [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.3-inbounds#3.3.1)

Step 1

: When an aircraft calls inbound, the aircraft symbol will flash amber on the map as well as their callsign on the flight progress strip



Step 2

: Either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 3

: Determine the pattern entry required, then tap "Pattern Instructions > [select Pattern Entry] > [select RWY] > Send"



Step 4

: Once the aircraft has been given a pattern entry (and sequence if not number 1), the aircraft can be cleared by tapping "Cleared to Land/For the Option > [select number] > [select Cleared to Land/Cleared for the Option] > [select RWY]"



Tip

: If the aircraft is not number 1, once you know which aircraft they are following, sequencing can be given by tapping "Sequencing... > [select number] > [select current position of traffic to follow]"

| Technique 1                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1: Only send a pattern entry to the aircraft you are unsure about in terms of sequencing |
| 2: Wait until the aircraft are closer, and once certain of their sequence, issue this along with their clearance |

| :fa-check-circle: | Offers flexibility                                           |
| :fa-check-circle: | Ensures aircraft know who they are following                 |
| :fa-times-circle: | May increase workload as you have to send two separate commands |

| Technique 2                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1: Send a pattern entry and the most likely sequence to all aircraft |
| 2: Monitor and if required, change the sequence as they get closer |

| :fa-times-circle: | Aircraft may be unsure who they are following if the sequence is given too early |

{.prosandcons}



Tip

: Work from the inside out by making sure that all aircraft closest to the airport have been given a pattern entry, sequence (unless they are number 1) and clearance. Then progressively work your way out to all the other aircraft!

## Runway Changes

Once a runway assignment has been issued, it would be ideal if we did not need to change it. However by using all available runways, changing the assigned runway (if required) is a useful tool to help deal with a dynamic environment and promoting an efficient operation.



Manual

: If a runway change is issued, a new pattern entry and clearance **must**{.red} be given (the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic). [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.3-inbounds#3.3.3)



[INSERT CLIP]



Step 1

: If an aircraft requests a runway change, the aircraft symbol will flash amber on the map as well as their callsign on the flight progress strip



Step 2

: Either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 3

: If the Controller is unable to grant the request, tap "Unable"



Step 4

: If the Controller is able to approve the request, or if the Controller decides to issue a runway change without a request from the aircraft (e.g. due to traffic), determine the pattern entry required, then tap "Pattern Instructions > [select Pattern Entry] > [select RWY] > Send"



Step 5

: Once the aircraft has been given a pattern entry (and sequence if not number 1), the aircraft can be cleared by tapping "Cleared to Land/For the Option > [select number] > [select Cleared to Land/Cleared for the Option] > [select RWY]"



Tip

: If the aircraft is not number 1, once you know which aircraft they are following, sequencing can be given by tapping "Sequencing... > [select number] > [select current position of traffic to follow]"

| Technique 1                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1: Instruct *I F A E Eleven* to "enter right downwind RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” |
| 2: If you are concerned about a conflict on the other end, then you can also tell *I F A E Eleven* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to alleviate this |
| 3: When you clear *I F A E Eleven*, you can then give them left traffic if you wish to do so to move them onto that side for subsequent patterns |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1: Instruct *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind”                     |
| 2: When you are happy with the separation, tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” |
| 3: If during this time, *I F A E Eleven* starts a right turn for RWY32R, then adopt Technique 1 instead |

| Technique 3                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1: Instruct *I F A E Eleven* "extend upwind, I'll call your crosswind” |
| 2: Wait until separation between *VP-MAX* and *I F A E Eleven* is adequate (you can expedite this by telling *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind"), and then tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” |
| 3: The new pattern entry supersedes the previous instruction |

{.technique}

| Technique 3       | Pro or Con?                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :fa-check-circle: | Prevents *I F A E Eleven* from entering right downwind       |
| :fa-times-circle: | May add confusion when a pattern entry is used instead of "turn crosswind" |

Tip

: Remember that other variables (such as terrain) might influence what is the best technique to use on the day, be flexible!

## Cleared for the Option



Manual

: If an aircraft is in the pattern "Cleared for the Option" **must**{.red} be used as it gives the pilot the option of a landing / touch & go / stop & go or low approach. [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.3-inbounds#3.3.5)



[INSERT CLIP]



Step 1

: When an aircraft calls inbound for touch & go's, the aircraft symbol will flash amber on the map as well as their callsign on the flight progress strip



Step 2

: Either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 3

: Determine the pattern entry required, then tap "Pattern Instructions > [select Pattern Entry] > [select RWY] > Send"



Step 4

: Once the aircraft has been given a pattern entry (and sequence if not number 1), the aircraft can be cleared by tapping "Cleared to Land/For the Option > [select number] > [select Cleared for the Option] > [select RWY] > [select send or make left/right traffic]"



Tip

: If the aircraft is not number 1, once you know which aircraft they are following, sequencing can be given by tapping "Sequencing... > [select number] > [select current position of traffic to follow]"



| Options                   | When to Use                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Send"                    | If the aircraft has already been instructed to make left/right traffic from the initial take-off clearance or the previous landing clearance |
| "Make Left/Right Traffic" | If the pilot is given a new pattern entry or new runway      |
